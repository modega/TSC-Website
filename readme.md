## WHAT IS IT
    > This was a freelance website project I've done back in the day but since the group that requested the website
    > has dissolved, now I have no obligations to keep this work private.
    > The website is mostly done with Bootstrap, HTML and CSS and also there is some PHP in it for lightweight
    > backend stuff
